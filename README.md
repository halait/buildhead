# Buildhead
A 2d physics based puzzle game with a focus on user created content playable in the browser. It uses my physics engine called [Pulsition](https://github.com/halait/pulsition) to simulate physics, WebGL for rendering graphics and Firebase as the cloud provider.

Visit [https://buildhead.web.app/](https://buildhead.web.app/) to play the game.
